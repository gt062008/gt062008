AWSCLI Cross Account Access Profiles
Synopsis
The script crossaccountprofiles.sh will ask the initiator for information. Once the info has been submitted the script will add the target cross account profile into the config file.
Information Required
Root Account IAM Username
Root Account AWSCLI profile configured
Root Account AWSCLI profile name
Target Account ID
AWSCLI config file location (default: ~/.aws/config)
Preperation
Copy the script and store locally. This is because variables will be changed based on the user. + Open the script with an editor and change the variable:
CONFIG='UserProfile/.aws/config'
Run Script
Run the bash script and enter the variables as prompted.
Root Account IAM Username
Root AWSCLI Profile Name
Target Account ID Confluence Site
CrossAccount AWSCLI Profile Name (User Preference)
Once the data is inputted the script will complete and output the entry made into the config file. Read the output and confirm all is okay.
Test
Dependant on the IAM Role permissions the easiest command to try will be:
aws s3 ls --profile <CrossAccount Profile Name>
Enter your Root Account MFA token and the command should run as expected and list S3 buckets in the account you have crossed into.
NOTES
The script automatically makes the Cross Account AWSCLI profile default to:
region = eu-west-1
output = json
If you wish to change this than edit the script for future profiles or manually change them by editing the CONFIG file.
