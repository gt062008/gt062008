WINSYNC
       Creating a Windows AD Synchronization agreement is similar to  creating
       an IPA replication agreement, there are just a couple of extra steps.

       A  special  user  entry  is created for the PassSync service. The DN of
       this entry is uid=passsync,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,<basedn>. You are  not
       required to use PassSync to use a Windows synchronization agreement but
       setting a password for the user is required.

       The following examples use the AD administrator account as the synchro-
       nization user. This is not mandatory but the user must have read-access
       to the subtree.

       1. Transfer the base64-encoded Windows AD CA Certificate  to  your  IPA
       Server

       2. Remove any existing kerberos credentials
                # kdestroy

       3. Add the winsync replication agreement
                #   ipa-replica-manage   connect  --winsync  --passsync=<bind-
              pwd_for_syncuser_that     will_be_used_for_agreement>     --cac-
              ert=/path/to/adscacert/WIN-CA.cer    --binddn    "cn=administra-
              tor,cn=users,dc=ad,dc=example,dc=com" --bindpw  <ads_administra-
              tor_password> -v <adserver.fqdn>

       You will be prompted to supply the Directory Manager's password.

       Create a winsync replication agreement:

               #   ipa-replica-manage  connect  --winsync  --passsync=MySecret
              --cacert=/root/WIN-CA.cer        --binddn        "cn=administra-
              tor,cn=users,dc=ad,dc=example,dc=com"  --bindpw MySecret -v win-
              dows.ad.example.com

       Remove a winsync replication agreement:
               # ipa-replica-manage disconnect windows.ad.example.com

PASSSYNC
       PassSync is a Windows service that runs on  AD  Domain  Controllers  to
       intercept  password changes. It sends these password changes to the IPA
       LDAP server over TLS. These password changes bypass normal IPA password
       policy settings and the password is not set to immediately expire. This
       is because by the time IPA receives the password change it has  already
       been accepted by AD so it is too late to reject it.

       IPA  maintains  a  list  of DNs that are exempt from password policy. A
       special user is added automatically when a winsync  replication  agree-
       ment  is  created.  The  DN of this user is added to the exemption list
       stored in passSyncManagersDNs in  the  entry  cn=ipa_pwd_extop,cn=plug-
       ins,cn=config.

EXIT STATUS
       0 if the command was successful

       1 if an error occurred
